# Roadmap

This doc captures where HQ is now and what remains. Older phase labels are historical context only; several items that used to be described as Phase 2 or Phase 3 are now implemented.

## Shipped

### Foundations

- One repo (`yourhq/yourhq`) for UI, gateway, dispatcher, runner, templates, migrations, and installers
- `docker-compose.yml` stack with four services
- Interactive `installer/install.sh` with local, Tailscale, and public networking modes
- Gateway runtime with OpenClaw, Chrome/Chromium, Xtigervnc, XFCE, noVNC, and files API
- Agent templates bundled into the image
- Multi-arch GHCR images for amd64 and arm64
- Multi-gateway database model with `gateways` and `agents.gateway_id`
- Gateway file browser/editor through the files API
- Tailscale as a host-level dependency, not a container dependency

### Workspace and onboarding

- First-boot onboarding in the browser
- Project registry in `/config/projects.json` and `/config/secrets.json`
- Runtime Supabase config injection with no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` rebuild requirement
- Project switcher and project settings
- Supabase validation during onboarding
- Account creation/sign-in flow
- Workspace setup wizard with presets for owner profile, pipeline, fields, and streams
- CRM, tasks, documents, assets, automations, notifications, activity, and settings pages

### Gateway and provider operations

- Settings -> Gateways UI
- Single-use gateway registration tokens
- Generated gateway installer command
- Gateway health, stale heartbeat status, label editing, and URL override support
- noVNC desktop modal from the UI
- Settings -> Connections UI
- API-key, OAuth-paste, device-code, CLI-reuse, and local URL provider auth flows through the command runner
- Provider list, removal, refresh, and default-model command support

### Agent operations

- Agent creation wizard from templates
- Telegram token provisioning and pairing-code approval
- Agent file browser/editor
- Agent operations and command history
- Agent boot-context documents through `boot:all` and `boot:<agent-slug>` tags
- Agent triggers and inbox history
- Inline model/provider default selection
- Agent org chart through `reports_to_id`
- Runtime delegation context for managers and direct reports
- Per-agent LLM usage tracking and monthly budgets
- Budget warning/exceeded notifications and hard cutoff enforcement

### Observability and gateway management

- Gateway update from UI (pull images, restart) with confirmation dialog
- System page with Commands, Inbox, and Audit Log tabs
- Status, module, action, and actor filters across all log views
- Realtime subscriptions and pagination on all log views

## Next

These are the most useful near-term areas for contributors.

- **Migration runner** — replace copy/paste SQL instructions with a guided migration command or UI flow.
- **Templates source UI** — switch between bundled templates and a custom git URL per project.
- **Public deployment guide** — reverse proxy, Cloudflare Tunnel, TLS, and auth hardening examples.
- **Pretty tailnet URLs** — optional Tailscale Serve setup for users who want `http://hq` instead of ported URLs.
- **Richer budget pricing** — broader model pricing map and clearer treatment of unmetered providers.
- **Template docs** — per-template READMEs that explain intended role, tools, and first tasks.
- **Docs site** — render this repository's markdown docs at `docs.yourhq.ai`.

## Hosted Offering

`yourhq.ai` signup flow for users who do not want to self-host. This is a business-layer addition, not a product change; the self-hosted code should stay usable on its own.

- Account management service
- Signup and billing
- Automated Supabase project provisioning per tenant
- Automated gateway provisioning on managed hosts
- Registry source swap: hosted UI reads project registry from account infrastructure instead of `/config/projects.json`

## Longer-Term Ideas

- Per-agent view in the Open Desktop modal with pause, takeover, and resume
- Agent-to-agent workflow builder
- Native apps such as macOS menu bar and iOS Shortcuts integration
- Marketplace for community templates
- MCP-first integrations where they can replace direct plugins cleanly
- Stronger per-agent isolation for operators who need stricter security boundaries

## How To Influence The Roadmap

- Open issues labeled `feature-request` with a clear use case.
- Start discussions in `github.com/yourhq/yourhq/discussions`.
- Send PRs for docs, templates, UI polish, gateway hardening, or well-scoped integrations.
- For large architecture changes, open an issue first so the design can be discussed before implementation.
